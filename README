# KeePassDroid
Refactored from upstream at https://github.com/bpellin/keepassdroid.

At the moment the initial mission here is to make it build, which it now does.

This are likely slightly messed up regarding packet names atm.

## Finding so far
### sha2-07-01-07.zip
The absents of any sha2-07-01-07.zip resolved using https://github.com/Rupan/sha. This lib is now bundled in the repo.

### NDK build
For now build using Android Studio 1.3 and experimental gradle plugins for NDK stuff.
Build config created from this samples
- https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/new-build-system/gradle-experimental
- https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk
- https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/android-ndk-preview

Also this is probably lacking things for making release builds, other than signing config.

### JDK
Setting AS to use JDK7 is required to make it build. JDK8 won't build, JDK6 will probably.



Leaving this old instructions for now, tho not used.

Native library build instructions:
1. Make sure you have the latest MIPS Android NDK installed: 
   https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html

2. From KeePassDroid/jni, call prep_build.sh to download and unpack the crypto sources.

3. From the KeePassDroid root directory, call ${path-to-ndk}/ndk-build
